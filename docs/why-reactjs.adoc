ReactJS is a JavaScript framework that makes it easy to build large and complex user interfaces as web applications.
It is based on a component philosophy in which each element in a web application is a React component and controls itelf and its structure through state and props.

For us this makes it easy to seperate components into external libraries which can be reused in any React application.

This application then works as a parent to all our libraries and lets us implement them together in a way fit for
purpose.
