= Note

At the moment this application imports **dc-react-components-library** and **dc-react-workflow** directly from GitHub
which means that you need readaccess to the repositories in order to fetch them as dependencies. This will change later
when we get to upload React libraries to Nexus or go public. This also means that updates to dependencies **will not be**
reflected unless you run `yarn upgrade`.
