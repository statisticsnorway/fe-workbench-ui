This is a fairly small application which implements and structures its functions through imported libraries.

So far it provides the ability to login and it "gsim-browsing" function comes from dc-react-components-library
and its workflow functions comes from dc-react-workflow-library.

linked-data-store (LDS) provides the backend for data storage.
